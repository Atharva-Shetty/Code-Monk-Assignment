Task 1 dataset link was not wokring so this is the task 2 work with ipynb file

Fashion Product Image Classification
This repository contains the solution for Task 2 of the fashion product image classification project. The objective was to build a deep learning-based model that can predict the following attributes of fashion products given an image:

Color of the product
Type of product (e.g., T-shirt, shoes, etc.)
Preferable season to use this product
Gender (Men, Women, Unisex)
Task 1: Dataset Issue
The link provided for Task 1 of the project (fashion product dataset) was not accessible, so this part of the project was not completed. Only Task 2 is implemented and documented in this repository.

Task 2: Deep Learning Model
In Task 2, a deep learning model was built to predict the following attributes from fashion product images:

Color of the product: The model classifies the color of the product.
Type of product: The model classifies the product into categories like T-shirt, shoes, etc.
Preferable season to use this product: The model predicts whether the product is suitable for Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter.
Gender: The model predicts if the product is suitable for Men, Women, or Unisex.
